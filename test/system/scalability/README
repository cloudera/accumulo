Apache Accumulo Scalability Tests

The scalability test framework needs to be configured for your Accumulo
instance by performing the following steps.

WARNING: Each scalability test rewrites your conf/slaves file and reinitializes
your Accumulo instance. Do not run these tests on a cluster holding essential
data.

1.  Make sure you have both ACCUMULO_HOME and HADOOP_HOME set in your
    $ACCUMULO_CONF_DIR/accumulo-env.sh.

2.  Create a 'site.conf' file in the conf directory containing settings
    needed by test nodes to connect to Accumulo, and to guide the tests.

    cp conf/site.conf.example conf/site.conf

3.  Create an 'Ingest.conf' file in the conf directory containing performance
    settings for the Ingest test. (This test is currently the only scalability
    test available.)

    cp conf/Ingest.conf.example conf/Ingest.conf

    Each test has a unique ID (e.g., "Ingest") which correlates with its test
    code in:

    org.apache.accumulo.server.test.scalability.tests.<ID>

    This ID correlates with a config file:

    conf/<ID>.conf

To run the test, specify its ID to the run.py script.

    nohup ./run.py Ingest > test1.log 2>&1 &

A timestamped directory will be created, and results are placed in it as each
test completes.
